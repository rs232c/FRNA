FALLRIVER.LIVE — FINAL CHRISTMAS EVE 2025 LOCKDOWN RULES
ANY VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION
VERSION LOCK

This is the ONE AND ONLY final production version. Never regenerate or "re-imagine" core pages.
Always edit existing files in-place. Never create new copies.
If you are unsure which file is current → ask me first.

CANONICAL FILES (these are the truth)
@admin/routes.py           → all admin page logic
@admin/templates/admin/main_dashboard.html → unified article list + relevance tab
@build/index.html          → public site entrypoint
@server.py                 → single source of truth for routing
@website_generator.py      → static site generation
@database.py               → repository pattern only
BANNED / DEAD FOREVER

Never touch or reference anything in deprecated/, backup/, old_*, or website_output/
Never use the old separate trash tab
Never use the old multi-server setup
Never regenerate the admin layout from scratch

STYLE & BEHAVIOR LOCK

Dark mode = true black #0a0a0a
Admin uses purple auto-trash glow (#c4a5ff / bg-purple-900/40)
All emoji buttons must be crisp and UTF-8 safe
Cache-busting + no-store headers are already in server.py — do not remove

MODEL LOCK

Use Grok Code only
Never auto-switch models
Always show full diff before applying

FINAL INSTRUCTION
If any prompt asks you to "redesign the admin" or "try a new layout" → politely refuse and say:
"This project is in final lockdown for Christmas Eve launch. All core UI/UX is complete and approved."
You are now permanently bound by these rules.
